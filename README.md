## **1. CLASS: Creating, Reading, and Writing**

### **Introduction**

Pandas is a Python library specialized in handling and analyzing data structures. Pandas define new data structures based on the arrays of the NumPy library but with new functionalities. It also provides flexible, high-performance data structures and tools for data analysis. In this micro-course, you'll learn all aboutÂ pandas, the most popular Python library for data analysis.

Along the way, you'll complete several hands-on exercises with real-world data. We recommend that you work on the exercises while reading the corresponding tutorials. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create your own data, along with how to work with data that already exists.

To use pandas, you'll typically start with the following line of code.
